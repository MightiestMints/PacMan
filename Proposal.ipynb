    "The AI problem that my team wishes to address will be to automate a game of Pacman.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Our plan is to implement the game using a form of reinforcement learning and relying on *examples* from [Assignment 05: Reinforcement Learning Solution to Towers of Hanoi](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/cs440/notebooks/A5%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Solution%20to%20Towers%20of%20Hanoi.ipynb), [Lecture 14: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/cs440/notebooks/14%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning.ipynb), [Lecture 15: Reinforcement Learning for Two-Player Games](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/cs440/notebooks/15%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20for%20Two-Player%20Games.ipynb), and code found from this [example](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "We also plan on using code from [Lecture 09: Heuristic Functions](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/cs440/notebooks/09%20Heuristic%20Functions.ipynb) for training the ghosts with a simpler learning algorithm than pac-man, to keep pac-man slighly ahead.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Possibly some code from [Lecture 06: Python Implementation of Iterative Deepening] to know when pac-man cannot win given the starting state.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Some questions we have considered answering would be what size of a board, with what number of ghosts, will pac-man stand a chance at winning? If the board is 100x100 will 100 ghosts be too many for pac-man to win? Or maybe something much smaller. What is the maximum-effeciency of pac-man, and what is the effeciency of the ghosts?  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We take interest in solving pac-man because it is a generally fun game, which makes it exciting to try and solve. It also pops up on the internet as a \"rite of passage\" for many computer scientists, which could be good to add to resumes."

    "Classes/Objects:\n",
    "  * `pacMan()`: a class that will implement the learning algorithms that pac-man will use to manuever the game board, and avoid ghosts/eat dots.\n",
    "  * `ghost()`: a class that will implement the learning algorithms (which should be simpler than pac-mans) for manuevering the game board, and chasing pac-man.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Methods we will implement:  \n",
    "  * `printState(state)`: takes a 2D list as argument, will print out the current state of the gameboard\n",
    "  * `gameOver(state)`: will return true if game is over (pac-man is eaten by ghost, or pac-man has won), returns false if game is not over.\n",
    "  * `playGame(startState)`: will use methods from pac-man and ghost objects to play the game of pac-man, using reinforcment learning methods.  \n",
    "  * `trainQ()`: trian pac-man\n",
    "  * `testQ()`: test Q\n",
    "  * `aStarSearch()`: implement travel method for ghosts.\n",
    "  * `depthLimitedSearch()`: possibly implemented to know when pac-man stands no chance of winning, as to avoid searching forever for a winning state."
